# VampireExtractors
Requires ImageMagick to work!

Welcome to VampireExtractors, an app to extract spritesheet atlases (.png-.json couples) encoded by TexturePacker for Phaser 3, such as pre-1.6 Vampire Survivors, and combining them back into atlas.
It is written in Batch, so it is slow and not so effective, but at least it is free.

For it to work (at the moment) you need to put both .bat files into /img directory of the game, where .png-.json couples are located.

I will update this program to up-to-date game files when I succeed with extracting Il2Cpp Vampire SUrvivors. Or, actually, IF I succeed, since I am genuinly stuck.

All help with issues is appreciated
